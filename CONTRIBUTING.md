# Contributing

Patches and bug reports welcome.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llrhook/wanna-bet.git
cd wanna-bet
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # add your DISCORD_TOKEN
npm run db:migrate
npm run register-commands
npm run dev            # tsx watch — auto-reloads on save
```

**Don't use Docker on macOS for local dev.** Docker Desktop's network layer adds multi-second latency to Discord's WebSocket gateway, which causes interactions to expire before the bot can ack them. Run natively with `npm run dev`. Docker on Linux (the production VPS deploy) is fine.

## The one rule

**`BalanceService.transfer()` is the only function that may UPDATE `players.balance` or `bank.balance`.** Every grant, payout, fee, escrow, and refund goes through it. If you're writing `UPDATE players SET balance` anywhere else, stop.

## Before opening a PR

- `npm run build` passes cleanly under strict TypeScript
- `npm run db:migrate` succeeds against a fresh database
- If you touched a command, you tested it in a real Discord server
- No `.env` or token in the diff

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with: what you ran, what happened, what you expected, the bot logs, and the Discord error code if any. For security issues, email me privately at `victor.n.ivanov@gmail.com` instead of opening a public issue.
